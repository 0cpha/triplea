    Welcome to TripleA 1.9
    
    1.8 Migration Notes:
      Bots are unable to host 1.8 save games.
      It is recommended to simply use the 1.8 game engine to play any 1.8.0.9 game saves
      You can download the 1.8 game engine here: http://www.triplea-game.org/old_downloads/
      Otherwise 1.8 games can be played with the 1.9 game engine if you move all of the 1.8 maps into /users/YourUser/triplea/maps
      1.9 maps are stored in /users/YourUser/triplea/downloadedMaps

    No talking politics in the lobby! Take your political comments to a private game!
    Try out the 'automated hosts': Join one then select a map. Game starts when all players are taken.
